	  <h1>Matcha</h1>
	  <p>In late 2024 I was told my heart rate was too high and I could no longer drink caffeine that was rapidly absorbed into my bloodstream (coffee). DISATER!!! 
	  Well, I needed to find an alternative and I found matcha and tried it for the first time...I hated it. It was bitter, grassy, and nasty. So I continued to
	  live without caffeine. About 2 months later I saw a video called "Why you may not like matcha"...I watched it and discovered something, this green tea powder
	  has many different harvests, seasons, grades, and flavors. So, I bit the nail and bought a nice matcha powder, it was FANTASTIC. So I continued this hobby 
	  and it's been very beneficial. I've been more energized, have better skin, and I learned to like grass milk!</p>
