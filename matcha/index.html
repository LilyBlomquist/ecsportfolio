	  <h1>Matcha</h1>
	  <p>In late 2024 I was told my heart rate was too high and I could not longer drink caffine that was rappidly absorbed into my blood stream! DISATER!!! 
	  Well I needed to find an alternative and I found match and tried it for the first time...I hated it. It was bitter, grassy, and nasty. So I continued to
	  live without caffine. About 2 months later I saw a video called "why you may not like matcha"...IO watched it and discoverd something, this green tea powder
	  has many diffrent harvests, seasons, grades, and flavors. So, I bit the nail and bought a nice matcha powder, it was FANTASTIC. So I continued this hobby 
	  and its been very beneficial. Ive been more energized, better skin, and I learned to like grass milk!</p>
